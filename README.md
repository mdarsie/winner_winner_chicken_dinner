# Winner, winner, chicken dinner!
A JavaScript web app for playing Blackjack

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement HTML, CSS and JS skills learned by creating a blackjack web app. The player can choose how much money to buy in for and then play against a dealer a succession of hands. If a player is smart he will choose to end the game while he is ahead and walk away with a profit and a chicken dinner. ALternately, a player will eventually find himself broke and the game will end with the player broke and hungry.
